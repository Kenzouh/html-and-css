    <p><span id="span1">Togekiss (Japanese: トゲキッス Togekiss) </span>is a dual-type Fairy/Flying 
       Pokémon introduced in Generation IV. Prior to Generation VI, it was a dual-type Normal/Flying 
       Pokémon. It evolves from Togetic when exposed to a Shiny Stone. It is the final form of Togepi.</p>
    
    <p><span id="bold">Togekiss</span> is a white, avian Pokémon with an ovoid body. 
       While its feet are small and situated closely together, its wings are broad and triangular. 
       Red and blue triangular markings over its underside, and it has a short tail consisting of 
       three feathers. On the back of its head are three spikes: a red-tipped one on the right, a 
       blue-tipped one on the left, and a pure white one in the middle. <span id="bold">
       Togekiss</span> has a relatively flat face and small, black eyes. </p>

    <p><span id="bold">Togekiss</span> have long been known worldwide as bringers of blessings, being 
       depicted on good-luck charms since ancient times. It is said that <span id="bold">Togekiss</span> 
       brings good luck simply by virtue of its existence. However, they only appear in peaceful places 
       and have never been witnessed anywhere near conflict or turmoil, making their recent sightings 
       exceptionally rare. It shares many kind gifts and sweet blessings when it visits peaceful places 
       or sees people who avoid strife and respect the rights of others. However, <span id="bold">Togekiss
       </span> is a capable fighter, and can use a powerful energy wave in battle. As mentioned in the Sleep 
       Style Dex, seeing several <span id="bold">Togekiss</span> sleeping contently is a sign that peace 
       reigns in the area.</p>

    <p><span id="span2">Milotic (Japanese: ミロカロス Milokaross)</span> 
       is a Water-type Pokémon introduced in Generation III.</p> 
    
    <p>It evolves from Feebas when leveled up with its Beautiful condition high enough, or when traded 
       while holding a Prism Scale.</p>
    
    <p><span id="bold">Milotic</span> is an aquatic, serpentine Pokémon with a primarily cream-colored body. 
       It has red eyes with long, pinkish antennae above them. Additionally, there are long, hair-like fins 
       above its eyes, which begin thin and thicken towards the tips. These eyebrows extend to almost half 
       of <span id="bold">Milotic's</span> body length and will be longer on the female than the male. On 
       top of its relatively small head is a straight spike. Running down either side of its neck are three 
       black dots, similar to gills. Its lower body is a pattern of blue and pink, diamond-shaped scales 
       outlined with black. The tail consists of four large, blue fins with pink ovals in their centers. 
       Each of the tail fins overlaps the next slightly, causing it to resemble a fan. <span id="bold">
       Milotic's</span> scales are said to change color depending on the viewing angle, which has so far 
       only been depicted in Pokémon Battle Revolution.</p>
