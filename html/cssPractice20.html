    <header>
        <h2>Header Part</h2>
        <p>This is where the introductory content go.</p>

    <nav class="navbar">

    <main>
        <!-- Sub-Elements -->
        <aside>
            <h2>Aside Part</h2>

            <p><b>Side content:</b> this represents a section of a page that 
                consists of content that is tangentially related to the 
                content around the aside element, and which could be 
                considered separate from that content.</p>
        </aside>


        <section>
            <h2>Section Part</h2>

            <p><b>Dependent content:</b> you can put anything you want here.</p>

            <p>Pokémon is a Japanese media franchise consisting of video games, 
                animated series and films, a trading card game, and other related 
                media. The franchise takes place in a shared universe in which 
                humans co-exist with creatures known as Pokémon, a large variety 
                of species endowed with special powers.</p>
        </section>


        <article>
            <h2>Article Part</h2>

            <p><b>Independent Content:</b> example is a news article. Even if this 
                portion gets cut off or put in a different page, it'll still
                make sense. Unlike section, when section is put in a different
                page, for example, the topic is about Pokemon, then it was put
                to a cooking website, it won't make sense as it'll be irrelevant.</p>
        </article>
    </main>



    <footer>
        <h2>Footer Part</h2>

        <p>This is where the closing content go such as author info., copyright and 
            navigational links</p>
    </footer>
