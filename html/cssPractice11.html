            <h2>Togekiss</h2>
            <p>Togekiss is a white, avian Pokémon with an ovoid body. While its feet are small and situated 
                closely together, its wings are broad and triangular. Red and blue triangular markings over
                its underside, and it has a short tail consisting of three feathers.</p>

            <h2>Milotic</h2>
            <p>Milotic is an aquatic, serpentine Pokémon with a primarily cream-colored body. It has red 
                eyes with long, pinkish antennae above them. Additionally, there are long, hair-like fins
                above its eyes, which begin thin and thicken towards the tips.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="boxBelow">
            <h2>Garchomp</h2>
            <p>Garchomp is a bipedal, draconian Pokémon that is primarily dark blue in color. It has red on 
                its underbelly from the lower jaw to the middle of the abdomen, including the undersides of 
                its arms. A patch of gold comes to a point below the red on its belly, and a golden star 
                shape adorns the tip of its snout. Garchomp has horn-like appendages that resemble a jet or 
                plane's engines, giving it an appearance similar to a hammerhead shark. These horns allow it 
                to sense its prey from a long distance. Its large mouth features razor-sharp teeth. The feet 
                have three white talons, and each arm has a single large, white claw for a hand. Curved fins 
                sprout from the arms, creating wings that allow Garchomp to fly. Garchomp also has a large 
                dorsal fin and another on its tail that resembles a shark tailfin. The male's dorsal fin has 
                a notch on it. Pairs of small, white spikes protrude from its upper arms and legs, and there 
                are gill-like slits on the sides of the neck. The eyes are intense, with black sclerae and 
                gold-colored irises.</p>
